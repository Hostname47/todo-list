# Todo list

This is my first project in react, where I want to implement as much react concepts as possible. Also, I want to practice the advanced concepts as well including HOCs, Render optimization and hooks.

This app now is supported dark-light mode using styled components and context API

If you find something wrong here or you want to contribute you're very welcome ;)
